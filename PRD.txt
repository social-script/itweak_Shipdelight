# Product Requirements Document: Shipdelight API Integration for Reverse Pickups with QC

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating the Shipdelight API into the itweak_Sales application to enable reverse pickup creation with Quality Compliance (QC) enabled.

## User Flow
1. User fills out the Return Order form with all required details
2. User submits the form
3. System makes API calls to Shipdelight:
   - Generate authentication token (if needed)
   - Create a reverse pickup with QC enabled
4. System displays success/error notifications to the user
5. If successful, AWB number is displayed to the user

## Implementation Tasks

### Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Update AddReturnOrderModal to include all required Shipdelight API fields
- [ ] Add automatic volumetric weight calculation (l × b × h / 5000)
- [ ] Add Pincode-based City/State lookup for pickup and delivery addresses
- [ ] Create user feedback mechanism (toast notifications)
- [ ] Connect form submission to backend API endpoint
- [ ] Add validation for all required fields per Shipdelight API requirements

### Backend API Implementation
- [ ] Create token management service
  - [ ] Implement token generation via Shipdelight API
  - [ ] Add token storage mechanism
  - [ ] Add token refresh logic (for 24h expiration)
- [ ] Create reverse pickup endpoint
  - [ ] Accept form data from frontend
  - [ ] Transform data to Shipdelight API format
  - [ ] Set QC to "y" for all orders
  - [ ] Set auto_approve to "false" (for manual review)
  - [ ] Make authenticated request to Shipdelight booking API
  - [ ] Handle response and errors
  - [ ] Return appropriate response to frontend

### Data Mapping
- [ ] Map Order Details → Basic API parameters
  - [ ] Return Order No. → order_number
  - [ ] Invoice Value → invoice_total
  - [ ] Weight → actual_weight
  - [ ] Dimensions → length, breadth, height
  - [ ] Volumetric Weight → volumetric_weight
  - [ ] Pay Type → payment_method (PPD/COD)
- [ ] Map Item Details → line_items array
  - [ ] Item Description → name
  - [ ] SKU → sku
  - [ ] Quantity → quantity
  - [ ] Unit Price → unit_price
  - [ ] Item Weight → actual_weight
  - [ ] Return Reason → return_reasons
- [ ] Map Pickup Details → pickup object
  - [ ] Customer Name → vendor_name
  - [ ] Contact Number → phone
  - [ ] Address → address_1, address_2
  - [ ] City → city
  - [ ] State → state
  - [ ] Pincode → postcode
- [ ] Map Delivery Details → shipping object
  - [ ] Vendor Name → first_name
  - [ ] Contact Number → phone
  - [ ] Address → address_1, address_2
  - [ ] City → city
  - [ ] State → state
  - [ ] Pincode → postcode
- [ ] Map GST Details → gst_details object (if invoice ≥ 50,000 INR)
  - [ ] GST Number → gst_number
  - [ ] CGST% → cgst
  - [ ] SGST% → sgst
  - [ ] IGST% → igst
  - [ ] HSN Number → hsn_number
  - [ ] E-way Bill Number → ewaybill_number

### Testing
- [ ] Test token generation and refreshing
- [ ] Test reverse pickup creation with QC
- [ ] Test error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test auto-calculation of volumetric weight
- [ ] Test Pincode-based City/State lookup
- [ ] Verify all data is correctly mapped to Shipdelight API format

### Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Document token management strategy
- [ ] Create user guide for the Return Order form

## Technical Considerations
1. Security: API keys and tokens must not be exposed in frontend code
2. Performance: Minimize API calls, implement efficient token management
3. User Experience: Provide clear feedback, implement loading states
4. Error Handling: Handle and display meaningful error messages
